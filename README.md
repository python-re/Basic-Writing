# Basic-Writing

An interactive reading and writing program that saves the end-user's responses to a document after their creation. Allows the user to continuously write to the document--which overrides its current contents. Similar to the number guessing program, there are plans to revamp and expand upon the contents of the document to allow for socket integration.
